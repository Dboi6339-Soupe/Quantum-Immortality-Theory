## This is a draft of my mini theory about the quantum immortality theory, which you can read about [here](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_immortality).

<div id="body-text">
<p> Imagine if each perspective of each person on the planet was a seperate universe in of itself, each perspective could be seen as a "line" on a blank white 2d plain where there is a lone intersection of all the "lines", that is the point of coexistence, how we physically and mentally interact with everybody else.  Quantum Immortality allows us to see where each "line" will end up.  Past the point of coexistence, every "line" has a start, but none have an end.  In each different perspective reality, that person cannot die, they aren't immune to severe damage however, so not being able to die in your perspective would be a delicate balance of not getting too injured or sick. </p>

<p> My theory is interpreting perspective reality and coming up with a rough estimate of how many people are in each perspective reality with a simple math equation.  Now do note, there is no guarantee that in my perspective - for example - you reading this are even alive, unless you communicate to me, I will never know.  Here's an explanation of what I just said: My cousin died in 2016 in my reality, but in his reality, he survived the gunshot, or maybe didn't even get shot in the first place, so there is a chance that in his reality I am showing him this theory. </p>
